## My Projects

### ML Spotfiy Mood Predictor & Other Mood Related Things 🎧😊
Currently, I'm working on a SpotiPy/sklearn project that will tell you your mood of your music with your recent listening history, or a given playlist:
- **Mood of Selected Playlist**: Let's you input one of your playlists, and it will tell you the mood of it.
- **Weekly Mood Trend**: Analyzes the last week of most-played songs to identify the mood of those tracks. It will then tell you the mood.
- **Mood Variance Last 12 Months**: Comming soon... I hope.

### Machine Learning & NLP in Threat Defense 🤖
Exploring the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **NLP** to enhance threat detection and hunting capabilities:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using ML models to identify unusual patterns.
- **Log Parsing**: NLP techniques for effective log analysis.
