# Welcome to IndiaAce's Lab! 🛡️🔍

## About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm **IndiaAce**, a **Detection Engineer** seeking to create cutting-edge detections and delve deep into all things cybersecurity. I blend threat hunting and attack simulation into a seamless CI/CD pipeline for detection creation. I play both offense and defense, ensuring a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.

## My Projects

### Autonomous Home Lab 🌐
Currently, I'm working on transforming my home lab into a fully autonomous environment that:
- **Simulates Attacks**: Automated scripts for realistic attack scenarios. I've thought about utilizing ChatGPT for this... still thinking...
- **Hunts Threats**: Advanced detection algorithms and threat intelligence integration.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration and deployment for seamless detection updates.

### Machine Learning & NLP in Threat Defense 🤖
Exploring the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **NLP** to enhance threat detection and hunting capabilities:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using ML models to identify unusual patterns.
- **Log Parsing**: NLP techniques for effective log analysis.
