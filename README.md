- 👋 Hi, I’m @IndiaAce you can just call me India! 
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and AI. I'm new at both so you're going to be seeing a lot of errors! I want to be as active as I can be here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with a focus on Tensorflow. I love data and math very much. I'm studying to get my BA in Computer Science this is my first year. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything AI related. I have a pipe dream of making some Spotipy programs.
- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me here, or shoot me an email indiaace@protonmail.com I look forward to chatting & colaborating with you!
